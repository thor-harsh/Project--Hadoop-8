# Project--Hadoop-8

**In this project we will look at integration of Hive with HBase**.<br></br>

Before going through the dataset  that we loaded in HBase and looking at different features of the dataset lets start by learning about Hive and HBase.<br>

**What is Hive?**

Apache Hive is a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system that enables analytics at a massive scale. Hive Metastore(HMS) provides a central repository of metadata that can easily be analyzed to make informed, data driven decisions, and therefore it is a critical component of many data lake architectures. Hive is built on top of Apache Hadoop and supports storage on S3, adls, gs etc though hdfs. Hive allows users to read, write, and manage petabytes of data using SQL.<br></br>

**What is HBase?**

  Apache HBase is an open-source, NoSQL, distributed big data store. It enables random, strictly consistent, real-time access to petabytes of data. HBase is very effective for handling large, sparse datasets.<br>
  HBase integrates seamlessly with Apache Hadoop and the Hadoop ecosystem and runs on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Amazon S3 using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) file system, or EMRFS. HBase serves as a direct input and output to the Apache MapReduce framework for Hadoop, and works with Apache Phoenix to enable SQL-like queries over HBase tables.<br></br>



  **This dataset which we downloaded contains 4 columns:** <br></br>
  **(UserId):** The user id of person<br></br>
  **(Age):** The age of the person<br></br>
  **(Gender):** The gender of the person<br></br>
  **(Occupation):** The occupation of the person<br></br>
   **(Zip):** The zip of the person<br></br>


   **Important Note: Please go through the dataset before jumping to the code**.


   **So what are you waiting for..? Jump to the code to get started learning this amazing stuff. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!
